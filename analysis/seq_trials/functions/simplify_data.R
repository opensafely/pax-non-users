# This function 
# 1. Modifies the variable 'status_primary' to 'status_seq'
# --> levels are 0 (no event/censored/noncovid death); 
#     1 (covid hosp/death)
# --> Of note, variable 'status_primary', ignores noncovid_hosp (assuming 
#     outcome can still occur after noncovid hosp, so individual is still at 
#     risk of experiencing the outcome (covid hosp/death))
# 2. Modifies the variable 'tb_postest_treat' to 'tb_postest_treat_seq'
# --> we classify people as untreated if they experience an event before or on
#     day of treatment and set their
#     tb_postest_treat to NA (= time between treatment and day 0)
# 3. variable 'treatment_seq' == 'treatment_prim'
# 4. variable 'fup_seq' == 'fu_primary'
